# Ozil Free Reddit

Look, I don't mind Ozil, he's a great player, he seems like an alright guy, but I'm honestly just sick of constantly seeing the same five news stories about him coming up on r/soccer and r/gunners. No one ever has any new insight about what's happening, everyone reasonable seems to agree we're not going to see anything new until his contract is up and everyone's allowed to talk about what happened a bit more freely, if you even care.
