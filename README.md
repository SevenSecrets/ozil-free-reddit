# Ozil Free Reddit

Look, I don't mind Ozil, he's a great player, he seems like an alright guy, but I'm honestly just sick of constantly seeing the same five news stories about him coming up on r/soccer and r/gunners. No one ever has any new insight about what's happening, everyone reasonable seems to agree we're not going to see anything new until his contract is up and everyone's allowed to talk about what happened a bit more freely, if you even care.

So, I'm making this extension to just hide any news stories or posts about him specifically from reddit, so that I don't get dragged into scrolling through pointless circular arguments about him where everyone talks past each other because they made up their minds 8 months ago.

### To Do:
- get the contentScript to run every time the page loads new content, rather than just on the initial load
- once I've done that, try to make sure it doesn't iterate through everything again somehow, since that would be a bit inefficient
- stop making ozil fanboys so mad I guess?
